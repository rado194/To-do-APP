                   ======================= To-Do APP ======================
            
* Initial project planning: The Todo application was a very recommended beginner Javascript project and I decided to put my own spin on it as part of my self development journey. 

* Summary: in order to use the application, the user has to type a word in the "Add a task!" box and then submit it using the "Submit button". After submitting, the application generates a new list of numbered words in the form of tasks for the user to do. The user can then either delete the task, mark it as complete or just delete the whole list with the "Clear List" button. There is also the option to filter between tasks, where the user can view all, the completed or even the uncompleted tasks he has typed. 


* Development experience: One main takedown of the experience of coding this application is that itt helped me improve my skills of writing clearer code and separating it into sections. I started the application with styling the page and creating the input buttons first. Then the tricky part was to find a way to use Javascript to generate new elements on the page once the input is submitted. Afterwards, once that was completed I found different animations to make the app look better and used the local storage to store the newly generated words even when the browser was closed. This allowed me to further improve my skills with understanding different logics and algorithms and was a very good experience all in all. 

* Bugs: While I was coding the application, there were many bugs in relation to the style of the page and the functionality of some of the buttons. Especially tricky was to use the filter and make it display the correct information when each of the options was selected. 

* Future improvements: If I could improve the application in future times, I would add Bootstrap in my styling in order to simplify the process and ensure I have more time to focus on the functionality of the project instead of the display. Another functionality that could improve and make the app more presentable would be also adding an API that always displays the correct date and time, even the weather of the day.


                 ===================== Project plan deliverables ===================
                                    
* Scope: 
01 - What are you aiming to build? - browser based To-do application
02 - What features will it have? - A submit button where I can add my to-do items, a list that is created after I press "Submit" and I will be able to add any tasks I would like to that list. I will also be able to delete or edit my tasks. 
03 - What do you think you can implement in the time period? - Implement all the functionality of the application, ensure it is displayed well and easy to use and understand
